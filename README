arduino-ecg is a heartbeat detector for ECG signals measured with Arduino
devices. It detects heartbeats and prints them to the serial stream. The
analysis of the respiratory variation of QRS amplitude supported, so each
heartbeat comes with an estimation of respiration phase.

Run "bash build.sh" in src_test to build a Python wrapper for the algorithm.
The wrapper can be used for simulating the algorithm with test data
(simulation_test.py) and plotting its output (plotting_test.py).
